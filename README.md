a simple nodejs script to scrape gas prices for a given zip code.

intended to be used on a unix-like machine like so:

    node app.js &>> OUTPUT

where OUTPUT is the path to the file where scraped information should go

output is formatted as such:

<station_name>@@@<address>@@@<price>@@@<scraped_time>@@@<recorded_time>

with the following types:
station_name: string,
address: string,
price: float,
scraped_time: timestamp,
recorded_time: string

scraped time is the system time when the scraping occurred; recorded time is a
string extracted from the page that tells you how long ago the price was updated,
if such a string exists (ex: Sams Club does not have an equivalent, so
recorded_time is the same as scraped_time).

# server.js
server.js is intended to be given the totally qualified directory to the file generated by app.js,
and will serve the contents of the file as json on a specified port.
